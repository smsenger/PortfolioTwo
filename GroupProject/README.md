DESCRIPTION

The Enhance Your Vibes web application was created to provide both an escape from our stressful world and a way to channel feelings of frustration, since sometimes 
catharsis is more effective for handling frustration and depression. On the "Good Vibes" page, users can view uplifting content, which includes page styling. On the "Bad Vibes" page, users can channel their frustration as they view a page styled with flames and dark colors. The APIs utilized on each page (7 in total) are below:
